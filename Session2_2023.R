#DATA STRUCTURES/ OBJECTS ####
###################################0

#Think of objects as boxes. The names of the objects are only labels. 
#Just like with boxes, it is convenient to label boxes in a way that is indicative of their contents, 
# but the label itself does not determine the content.

# R provides many functions to examine features of vectors and other objects, for example

#class() - what kind of object is it (high-level)?
#typeof() - what is the object's data type (low-level)?
#length() - how long is it? What about two dimensional objects?
#attributes() - does it have any metadata?


# Create a vector.
apple <- c('red','green',"yellow")
class(apple)

# Examining Vectors
# The functions typeof(), length(), class() and str() provide useful information about your vectors and R objects in general.


## coercion: You can also control how vectors are coerced explicitly using the as.<class_name>() functions:
#vectors of different classes
xx <- c(1.7, "a")
class(xx) #R implicitly coerces them to class or data type character
xx <- as.integer(xx) # R explicitly coerces them to class type integar, introducing NAs
xx # "a" becomes NA --- USEFUL to know when dealing with data sets 

# let's create another vector
x <- c(1, 3, 5, 7) # if you already have another object called x, this will rewrite the old x!
class(x)
length(x) # how many elements of x?
str(x) # structure of x

# you can use : to generate a sequence of numbers
x<- 1:10
print(x) #or just x

# seq can be used to create sequences
x <- seq(0, 1, 0.05)
x  
?seq

# let's work with bigger vectors
x <- seq(1, 100, 1)

# you can use logical operations to check elements of x. e.g.:
y <- x<5 # returns TRUE / FALSE for each element of x

y <- x[x!=5] # outputs values of x that are leq 5 
# these can now be assigned another object! ==> Very useful in analytics


# you can find individual elements of vector x, i.e. x[i]
x[3]  
x[5]
x[5] - x[99]

### D100 STOP # 18-JAN 

# let's create a matrix
M = matrix(1:12, 3, 4) # the colon implies sequences
M
# like vector, you can call specific elements in M[i,j]
M[1,3]

# you can call indiviual rows or columns (to assign to other objects)
M[3,] # row 3 of M
M[,2] # inverted column 2


#### FACTORS (These are a bit weird)
#They are used mainly for telling R that a vector represents a categorical variable.

# create a vector of 15 "control"s and 15 "treatment"s
# rep stands for 'repeat', which is exactly what the function does, similar to sequence
x <- rep(c("control", "treatment"), each = 15)
x

# let's convert or coerce x into a factor
x <- as.factor(x)
x 
# The first thing to notice is the line under the last printout that says "Levels: control treatment". 
# This informs you that x is now a factor with two levels (or, a categorical variable with two categories).
typeof(x) # x is stored as an int!
class(x) # but the object is of class/data structure factor!


# we can coerce factors to numeric to strip labels "control and treatment"
x <- as.numeric(x)
x # all controls became 1 and treatment became 2
# you can coerce them back! Try it! look up how to assign new labels!
x <- as.factor(x)
x

### TREAT ALL CATEGORICAL VARS IN YOUR DATA as factors

# let's play around some more
# let's reassign x
x <- rep(c("control", "treatment"), each = 15)
x <- as.factor(x)
attributes(x) # check the structure
x

# Thing to remember with factors:
# The fact that factors in R are represented as labelled integers has interesting implications 
# First, certain functions will coerce factors into numeric vectors which can shake things up. 
# This happened when you used cbind() i.e. func to combine rows or columns  on a factor with levels 0 and 1:
cbind(x[1:15], x[16:30])
# cbind() binds the vectors you provide into the columns of a matrix. 
#since matrices can only contain logical, numeric, and character elements, 
# the cbind() function coerces the elements of the x into numeric, stripping the labels and leaving only 1s and 2s like we saw before

# back to x 
attributes(x) # check the structure
# notice the labels or levels are separate from elements  
# => even if you delete some of the numbers, the labels stay the same
# let's demonstrate - plotting factors is easy! more on that later
plot(x) 
x <- x[1:20] # removing the last 10 obs
plot(x)  # labels stay!
x <- x[1:15] # removing all "Treatments"
x    
plot(x)  # labels stay! even if no values for treatment

## E100

### NOTE # Special cases:   
#1:   NA, stands for "not applicable" and is used for missing data. 
# Unlike other kinds of elements, it can be bound into a vector along with elements of any class.

#2: NaN, stands for "not a number". 
# It is technically of class numeric but only occurs as the output of invalid mathematical operations, 
# such as dividing zero by zero or taking a square root of a negative number:

# 3. INTRO TO FUNCTIONS ####
###################################0

# write a function so that we can repeat several operations with a single command

## Defining a Function in R
## You can write your own functions in order to make repetitive operations using a single command. 
# Step1: Start by defining your function “my_function” or "fn_1" and the input parameter(s) that the user will feed to the function. 
# Step2: Afterwards you will define the operation(s) that you desire to program in the body of the function within curly braces ({}). 
# Step3: Finally, you need to assign the result (or output) of your function in the return statement if desired.
## In R, it is not necessary to include the return statement. R automatically returns whichever variable is on the last line of the body of the function. 
# While in the learning phase, we will explicitly define the return statement.


# let's create a vector of numbers the mean of which I want to calculate
vec <- c(103, 1, 1, 6, 3, 43, 2, 23, 7, 1)

# see what's inside
vec

# let's get the mean
# mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values
sum(vec)/length(vec)

# good, now let's create a function that calculates the mean of whatever we ask it to
# let's make this function as an object
fn1 <- function(x){
  sum(x)/length(x)}
   # stored in environment!
# the code inside the object fn1 is reusable


# to run function:
fn1(vec) # returns mean of vec!
# we can assign this to another object
mean.vec <- fn1(vec)

### this is VERY USEFUL in analytics


###Let this be your mantra: "If I want to keep it for later, 
#I need to put it in an object so that is doesn't go off." 


# In class Exercise:

## Write a function to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius

# With a defined return object 
fn_F2C <- function(temp_F) {
  temp_C <- (temp_F - 32) * 5 / 9
  return(temp_C)
}

fn_F2C(32)

# WithOUT a defined return object 
fn_F2C_2 <- function(temp_F) {
(temp_F - 32) * 5 / 9
}

fn_F2C_2(32)

# The output is the same! The difference matters when you have more complex calculations there multiple calculations need to be saved.

# For this example we'll use a very simple dataset. 
# The cars data comes with the default installation of R. 
# to see all pre-loaded datasets, simply type data()

# to see a desc of the data
?cars
# also try  for mtcars dataset 

# To see the first few columns of the data, just type head(cars).
head(cars)

# let's create a data frame object and assign it to the default cars data
dt <- cars 

#check the structure of dt
str(dt)

View(dt) # let's see this data
# we have obs for speed and stopping distance for cars in 1920s

# let's calculate  average and std dev of speed and distance
avg.speed <- mean(dt$speed) # notice the $ to point the general function mean to a specific column!
avg.distance <- mean(dt$dist)

sd.speed <- sqrt(var(dt$speed))
sd.distance <- sqrt(var(dt$dist))

# let's visualize the data
hist(dt$dist) # histogram of distance
hist(dt$speed)
plot(dt$speed)
plot(dt$dist)
# let's see relationships
cor(dt) # simplistic correlation matrix
plot(dt$speed,dt$dist) # simple scatter plot
